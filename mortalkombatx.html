			Game Description:<br/>
			Mortal Kombat X combines cinematic presentation with all new gameplay to deliver the most brutal Kombat experience ever, offering a new fully-connected experience that launches players into a persistent online contest where every fight matters in a global battle for supremacy. For the first time, Mortal Kombat X gives players the ability to choose from multiple variations of each character impacting both strategy and fighting style. Players step into an original story showcasing some of the gameâ€™s most prolific characters including Scorpion and Sub-Zero, while introducing new challengers that represent the forces of good and evil and tie the tale together.<br/>
			The Mortal Kombat series have come a long way. I remembered back when I was a kid, I heard of the game Mortal Kombat and its popularity as a fighting game. With each successive game created, the game reinforces itself with even better graphics, gameplay, and mechanics.<br/>
			Each of the 25 characters has three distinct sets of abilities. This makes the game much more enjoyable and not repetitive to play. Since each character has something unique to his or her kit, you can create many fun fighting styles. The fighting engine is amazing and probably the best NetherRealm Studios has created, with hugely improved animation, varied characters, and interactive elements. <br/>
			The new online "faction war" mode offers many dynamic challenges and fun. The story and gameplay are incredible and packed with new theatrical choreography and kitsch martial arts absurdity. They offer as an entertaining casual alternative to the demanding brutality of the online world. <br/>

			Some of the characters of the game: <br/>
			Ermac - Ermac is a ninja whose soul energy allows him to levitate and toss his opponent around the map. <br/>
			Shinnok - Shinnok's ability mimcks other fighters' moves as one of his many abilities. <br/>
			D'Vorah - D'Vorah is an insect-like warrior who can summon wasps and other bugs and use them as weapons.
